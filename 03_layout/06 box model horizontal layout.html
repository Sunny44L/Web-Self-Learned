                element's horizontal layout
                    horizontal layout uses the following
                        -margin-left
                        -border-left
                        -padding-left
                        -width
                        -padding-right
                        -border-right
                        -margin-right
                    
                    one element inside of its father element must satisfy the following equation
                        -margin-left+ border-left+ padding-left+ width+ padding-right+ border-right+ margin-right
                        =equote to its father element's width (must)

                        0 + 0 + 0 + 200 + 0 + 0 + 0 =800

                        The following statement is for auto condition, 过度约束，only when equation is not satisfy
                        if the equation is not satisfy, the broswer will automatically make the last number to increase to make equation satisfy
                            -which is margin-right
                * As result, margin-right will not be coded, because it will be automatic

                        in 7 value, if there are 3 of them set as auto：
                            width
                            margin left
                            margin right
                            -as any of these set as auto, the equation will make this auto to complete equation

                        If width and margin-left are set as auto, then width will be auto and margin-left will be 0
                        if all 3 are auto, then only width will be set and other margin left and right will be 0
                        If width is set, and both margin are auto, then both margin will be set as same number. 
                            -therefore, we always use this function to make element to center in its father element
                                example
                                width: xxx px;
                                margin: 0(mean top and bottom) auto;


                Margin could be negative is width is exceeding its father element
