        defualt viewport on mobile is 980 pixels
            -to ensure pc website can be shown on mobile
            -if website is bigger than 980, mobile browser wil shrink 
                the website to fit in

            -because the website is too small for mobile,
                therefore, most company had develop a mobile version of their website
