            3 types of logic operator

            !  (NOT) turn true into false, false into true
                -use ! to turn a Boolean into the opposite one
                -when use !! will not change the boolean value
                -!a turn the value into Boolean, then takes the opposite
                    -use this 

                It is like the NOT of electric board

            && (AND)
                -&&, combine two data and see both as one result
                -rule, 
                    -as long as one false in two data, result is false
                    -only when both are true, the result is true

                -in this function it will look for false, when false
                    is discover, it will not process the next one to
                    look for false

                It is like the AND in the electric board


            || OR
                -||, as long as one true, it will be true, 
                -opposite to AND gate
                -in this function it will look for true, when true
                    is discover, it will not process the next one to
                    look for true

                It is like the OR in the electric board
